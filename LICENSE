Hi Patrick,

Sorry for the slow response. My understanding is those images are all fine to use as long as they are used exclusively for activities that further scouting. They are not to be resold, which is why the theme is offered for free, "as is".

Hope this information helps. We made a couple subtle tweaks to the theme that will be available for download later today. 

Thank you.
